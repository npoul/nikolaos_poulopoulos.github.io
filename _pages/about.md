Research
======
I am currently a PhD Student at the [Department of Computer Engineering & Informatics](https://www.ceid.upatras.gr/en) at University of Patras. I received my M.Sc. degree from the same Department in 2017 and my B.Sc. degree from the Hellenic Airforce Academy in 2013. Since 2013, I have been working for the Hellenic Airforce as an Electronics Engineer.  

Research
======
My current research focuses on computer vision, machine learning and their applications to human-computer interaction. Specifically, I am working on eye tracking and gaze estimation with a single webcam.
